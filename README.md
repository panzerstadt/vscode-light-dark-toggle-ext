# light-dark-toggle README

toggle lives on the top right corner of your editor.

I made this toggle because I use Dark themes but everytime I needed to properly preview markdown files I wanted to view them in Light theme (plus copy pasting from markdown preview to a WYSIWYG editor like Jira also copies their color and background color! the horror!)

set your **Preferred Dark Color Theme** and **Preferred Light Color Theme** under your user settings and away we go!

### how to setup for your color themes

1. User Settings: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Type `color theme` in your searchbar
3. pick your preffered light and dark themes.
